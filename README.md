# m_carlock ( Optimized carlock script for FiveM )

> Really simple and optimized carlock script, because many big servers got a problem with the well-known carlock script ( overloading and causing lag spikes ) 

> You can remove the print and add a notify export

> Works with ESX and bbvehicles ( for vehicles database )

> Tested with 128 players online with 0.00ms ( all the time )

> Coded for like 10 minutes so don't judge me :<
